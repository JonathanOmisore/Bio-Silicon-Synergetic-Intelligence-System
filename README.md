## üß† Project Overview
At Synthetic Intelligence Labs, our mission is to harmonize biological cognition with computational rigor. We have embarked on an innovative venture that intricately fuses human cortical organoids with rat brains, unveiling a new era of bio-silicon synergetic learning. Our bespoke BCI system is a testament to this, with carbon nanotube-coated electrodes at its core, enhancing the fidelity of neural interfacing through self-optimizing signal pathways.

Our methodology is deeply rooted in bidirectional communication, leveraging AI to map cerebral signals onto interactive platforms, exemplified by our translation of neural impulses into gameplay dynamics. This iterative learning cycle commences at the cortical interface, progressing through an array of sophisticated OpenBCI boards, interfacing with our proprietary BrainFlow acquisition system, and culminating in our custom software. Here, our GUI provides an immersive analytical experience, inclusive of innovative visualizations such as the phase synchronization vortex.

Our system facilitates bidirectional communication, where brain surface signals are mapped via AI in a continuous learning process, translating neural activities into game movements and back. The process begins at the brain surface, with signals transmitted to dual Cyton+Daisy OpenBCI boards, then to BrainFlow for acquisition, and into our custom software and GUI for analysis, visualization, and control. Neural signals are decoded into game actions, and game data alongside rat self-movement data are encoded back into neuromimetic signals. These are then fed into the rat brain, synced with output signals, via a USB to TTL ft232rl connected to a CycloneIV FPGA board. The FPGA board, using UART for ft232rl and I2S for CS4344s, sends 32 signals to 16 CS4344s, which, being stereo, output to 32 AD620s, followed by resistors for voltage division, ensuring input levels match ECoG voltage.

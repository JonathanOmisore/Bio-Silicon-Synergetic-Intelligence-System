    Structure: All-glass biosafety cabinet with integrated pass-through chamber and gloves, capable of negative and positive pressure control.
    Gloves: Long rubber gloves attached to the cabinet using large flange/pipe straps. The connection to the glass wall is sealed with high-quality silicone or silicone glue for an airtight seal.
    Silicone Sealant: High-quality silicone sealant is used for all glass joins to provide a watertight and chemically resistant seal.
    Primary Chamber Features:
        UV Sterilization: Equipped with built-in UV-C lamps for sterilizing air and surfaces.
        HEPA Filtration: Continuous flow of HEPA-filtered air to remove particulates and microorganisms.
        Hinged Doors: Airtight hinged doors for internal access.
        Mechanical Latches: Ensure doors close tightly to maintain internal environment.
        Air Quality Monitoring: Sensors installed for monitoring air quality.
        LED Lighting: Strips along the top sides for illumination.
        Antistatic Measures: Fans and filters designed to minimize static buildup.
    Pass-Through Chamber Features:
        Airlocks with Hinged Doors: For material transfer without compromising internal environment. May include fans for air purging.
    Pressure Control:
        Positive Pressure: Used to prevent contamination ingress in non-hazardous settings.
        Negative Pressure: Used when working with hazardous substances to contain potential leaks.
        Pressure Monitoring: Continuous monitoring with gauges or sensors, equipped with alarms for pressure deviations.
    Ventilation:
        Air Changes: Controlled based on application needs, dictated by fan speed and chamber volume.
        Circulation Fans: Ensure even distribution of filtered air.
    Leak Testing: Conducted using smoke tests or pressure decay methods.
    Documentation: Logs maintained for all disinfection procedures, maintenance activities, and operational changes.

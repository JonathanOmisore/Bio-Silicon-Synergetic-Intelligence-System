Notes:

Signal going to brain must be synched with signal coming from brain
self organization and free energy principle, as well as self optimization of mapping neural signal to computer action/ computer environment to neural signal
mapping with supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as search for equilibrium through mapping optimization
process balance search between the best performing processes of brain/computer

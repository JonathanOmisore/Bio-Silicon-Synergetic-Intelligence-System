Symbolic Dynamics Generation:

    Convert complex neural data into a simplified, symbolic representation. This involves mapping continuous or discrete neural signals into a finite set of symbols.
    For historic data, apply in-depth analyses (like multifractal or recurrence quantification) to extract meaningful patterns and convert them into symbols.
    For live data, use faster analysis methods that can provide real-time symbolic representations.
    
Step 1: Symbol Definition and Mapping

    Define Symbol Set:
        Create a finite set of symbols, each representing a specific type of neural stimulus. For instance, different symbols could represent varying frequencies, pulse widths, or amplitudes of electrical stimulation.
        Each symbol should correspond to a distinct, recognizable pattern of neural activity.

    Data to Symbol Mapping:
        Develop an algorithm to map computational data (from sensors, models, etc.) to this symbolic set. For example, a high value in computational data might map to a symbol representing a high-frequency electrical pulse.    
    
Step 2: Signal Transformation

    Electrical Signal Parameters:
        Determine the parameters that effectively stimulate neural tissue. These include:
            Amplitude: The strength of the electrical signal.
            Frequency: How often the electrical pulses are delivered.
            Pulse Width: Duration of each electrical pulse.
            Waveform Shape: The shape of the signal, such as square, sinusoidal, or sawtooth.

    Symbol-to-Signal Conversion:
        Assign each symbol a specific combination of these parameters. For example, Symbol A could correspond to a low-frequency, high-amplitude pulse, while Symbol B could represent a high-frequency, low-amplitude pulse.
        Use your understanding of neural physiology to ensure these parameters are within a biologically relevant and safe range.

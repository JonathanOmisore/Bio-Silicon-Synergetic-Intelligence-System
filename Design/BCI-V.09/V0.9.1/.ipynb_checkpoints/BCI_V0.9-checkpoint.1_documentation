This document outlines the design specifications for a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system intended for the transmission and reception of neural signals between a biological brain/organoid and a computer system. The design is focused on the electronic components, signal processing units, and interfacing protocols, specifically employing Cyclone IV FPGAs for digital signal processing.
System Components
Analog Front-End (AFE)

    Instrumentation Amplifiers (IA): Each of the 64 channels is equipped with a separate PCB hosting an AD620 module to amplify neural signals. This configuration ensures clean signal acquisition with minimal interference.
    Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC): For every two channels, a separate PCB with a PCM1802 module is used, taking advantage of its stereo input capability to convert the analog signals into digital data with high fidelity.
    Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC): Similarly, every two channels share a PCB with a CS4344 module for converting digital signals back into analog form, maintaining the stereo output feature of the DACs.

Digital Processing Unit

    Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA): Cyclone IV FPGAs are responsible for the real-time processing and routing of neural signals, as well as the gain of the amps, and the system clocks.

Communication Protocols

    I2S

Power Supply Design

    Linear Regulators: To ensure clean power delivery, 3.3V and 5V linear regulators are used across the system. These regulators provide stable voltage levels and reduce noise, which is critical for maintaining signal integrity.

Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design

    Capacitors: A combination of 1 ÂµF, 100 nF, and 10 nF capacitors are strategically placed across the PCBs to filter out noise and stabilize the power supply lines, further enhancing signal quality.

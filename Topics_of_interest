Symbolic Dynamics
Stable states in neural activity can be associated with specific thoughts, intentions, or actions.
stable states are less likely to change abruptly, they provide a level of predictability 
Active states are periods of heightened neural activity that are often associated with specific cognitive or motor functions
inderstanding the transition between active and inactive states can help in setting adaptive thresholds
By focusing on the Markov blanket, a BCI system can filter out irrelevant information, improving decoding accuracy.
State Estimation
Markov blanket can be used to understand how external stimuli (encoded signals) influence the internal states of the brain

labels to these patterns, the original multichannel time series can be transformed into a symbolic sequence with multiple symbols instead of the original binary conversion
